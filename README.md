## Pixel Art Studio
### This project is a real-time pixel art studio in which users can connect with others over a local network and collaboratively create a pixel art drawing together.
Pygame is required to run the program.
The program can be used individually offline, or cooperatively with other users connected to the same local area network.
One user must run the server script at all times. Then, each user can run their own instances of the client script to interact with the art studio.
As long as the server script is running the progress made in the art studio will be preserved. If a user closes their instance of the client script and then reopens it, their art studio will be repopulated with the work done up to that point.
